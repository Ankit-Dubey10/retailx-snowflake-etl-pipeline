# 📌 Project Overview

Retail organizations receive sales data continuously from multiple branches and regions. Manual data preparation and reporting become slow, error-prone, and difficult to scale.

This project simulates a production-grade analytics pipeline that automatically:

- Generates monthly retail sales datasets
- Cleans and validates data using PySpark
- Loads data into Snowflake using internal stages
- Maintains pipeline execution logs
- Builds analytical views
- Powers an interactive Power BI dashboard

The entire workflow demonstrates how modern cloud data pipelines are designed for scalable analytics.

# 🔄 Pipeline Workflow

### 1. Synthetic Data Generation

- Generates 36 monthly retail sales datasets
- Simulates over **57,000 sales transactions**
- Includes customers, products, regions, discounts, targets, and returns

---

### 2. PySpark ETL

The pipeline performs:

- Schema validation
- Duplicate removal
- Currency normalization
- Date parsing
- Null handling
- Business-rule validation
- Feature engineering

---

### 3. Snowflake Loading

Processed files are:

- Uploaded using **PUT**
- Loaded using **COPY INTO**
- Stored in `RAW_TRANSACTIONS`
- Logged into `PIPELINE_LOG`

The pipeline prevents duplicate processing by checking previously ingested files.

---

### 4. Analytics Layer

Snowflake Views provide curated datasets for reporting:

- Clean Transactions
- Monthly Summary
- Salesperson Performance
- Pipeline Monitoring

---

### 5. Power BI Dashboard

Two interactive dashboard pages were built:

### 📊 Executive Overview

- Revenue KPIs
- Profit KPIs
- Customer Metrics
- Revenue Trend
- Regional Performance
- Product Category Analysis
- Customer Segment Distribution

### ⚙ Pipeline Health

- Pipeline Run Metrics
- Success Rate
- Rows Loaded
- Rows Rejected
- File Processing Distribution
- Pipeline Execution Logs
